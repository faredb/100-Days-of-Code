### Day 1: 23 April 2020
##### Resposive Web design Certification (300 hrs) @ FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first two modules of Resposive Web design Certification - Basic HTML & HTML5 and Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** Progressed through Basic HTML/HTML5 and CCS as I have previous experience with HTML and CSS2. I particularly enjoyed Classes vs IDs and CSS variables.
