Welcome to my GitHub where I will log my journey through 100 Days Of Coding. I have some experience of HTML, SQL/MYSQL, CSS. I have just started (day 2) Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp and look to continue through to JavaScript and Frontend Libraries. My current goal is to code front ends for SQL databases. In preparation to the 100 days I repurposed a laptop with Linux Debian 10, repurposed an Instagram account, added a GitHub repository, installed VS Code, joined the official 100 day Slack channel and cleaned my home office during the 5th week of Covid-19 lockdown. I will add the code for each of the projects starting with the six at the end of the first course in a week or so. I'll also have a look at GitHub Pages. Stay safe.

### Day 1: 23 April 2020
##### Responsive Web design Certification (300 hrs) @ FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first two modules of Responsive Web design Certification - Basic HTML & HTML5 and Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** Progressed through Basic HTML/HTML5 and CCS as I have previous experience with HTML and CSS2. I particularly enjoyed Classes vs IDs and CSS variables.

### Day 2: 24 April 2020

##### Installation of Visual Studio Code and GitHub intergration

**Today's Progress**: Installation of Git and Visual Studio Code with GitHub intergration. Researched and installed recommended extensions and tested with first commit to GitHub with this Day 2 update.

**Thoughts:** Like the Live Server extension. Removed bootstrap extension as it cluttered the intellisense, will reinstall when needed. Work flow is coming on now.

### Day 3: 25 April 2020

##### Responsive Web design Certification (300 hrs) @ FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: Currently working through Applied Visual Design.

**Thoughts:** Progressed through basic element adjustments and basic tags. Looking forward to working through the animation and transform properties today.

### Day 4: 26 April 2020

##### Responsive Web design Certification (300 hrs) @ FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Visual Design Module.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed this module a lot more than I thought I would. Pleasantly surprised by a mixture of how much more fun you can have with CCS3 compared to CSS2 (heart shape made purely out of CSS) and the CSS animations particularly the button hover over gradual colour change.
Was thinking about starting a page in GitHub Pages to practice on as I work through the modules but now after having a look at the project at the end of the course, I will wait and practice on those.

### Day 5: 27 April 2020

##### Responsive Web design Certification (300 hrs) @ FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, Flexbox and Grid completed.

**Thoughts:** What a long day! Applied Accessibility was interesting and covered lots from screen reader navigation to avoiding colourblindness issues with colour selection. before today I thought accessibility was mostly about alt tagging images and file names, now I know there are multiple disabilities to consider. Responsible Design Principles included a best practice of displaying images half size to allow for Apple Retina Displays, cant be right, I'll look into this. I found grid easier than flex to get my head around but have read that Flex has more support, we'll see how I feel once I'm coding the projects.

Looking forward to starting the projects tomorrow as I've seen they also consist of Agile user stories (product requirements) so the project will feel like real world work.

### Day 6: 28 April 2020

##### Responsive Web design Certification (300 hrs) @ FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first challenge, a tribute page to Ernest Ranglin.

**Thoughts:** The user stories were quite easy and I breezed through them in a few minutes giving me a pass. I then went over to VS Code and recreated the challenge only this time designed the page with what I had in mind- a large background picture of ER with a text box floating on the image. Enjoyed that.

I saw Ernest Ranglin perform at Ronnie Scotts London 2009

### Day 7: 29 April 2020

##### Daughter's Birthday! Responsive Web design Certification (300 hrs) @ FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: Started the second challenge, a survey page.

**Thoughts:** This one is slightly trickier but good practice adding classes and id's to the CSS for each div, label, input, etc. Not much of an update, mostly going back and reading through the previous challenges as I'm thinking I worked through them quite quickly. Have the basic setup done with the survey sitting central on the page and the input text and boxes in blocks. Should get the survey challenge completed tomorrow, at least enough to pass, but would like to also create another survey in VS Code which will look nicer, we'll see.

### Days 8/9/10/11: 30 April 2020 - 3 May 2020

##### Going back through the course! Responsive Web design Certification (300 hrs) @ FreeCodeCamp using VS Code

**Today's Progress**: last few days completed HTML & HTML5 and half way through CSS again...

**Thoughts:** whilst completing the Survey challenge I realised that I wasn't able to recall all syntax and even if I could I wasn't creating work I was proud to put in my portfolio.
I then decided to go through each challenge again but this time in VS Code which has not only given me more practice but has given me a holistic view of how everything works together.
I wish I had done this from the start along side completing the challenges in the FreeCodeCamp browser for certification. It's certainly taking longer but definately worth it.

### Day 12: 4 May 2020

##### Going back through the course! Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hrs) @ FreeCodeCamp using VS Code

**Today's Progress**: Completed the second run-through of the CSS module and starting to think about the survey form challenge.

**Thoughts:** Ive now completed the CSS module again, only this time in Visual Studio Code. It's great that I can get used to commenting as I go but also have examples of everything I have gone through with comments.
I have started thinking about the survey form again. I have narrowed my survey ideas between a aqua blue to green gradient background with 2 floating white divs and a night image of a busy place (Jamel Efna) and a floating blurred background form. I like the inputs that span the whole widths. Going to checkout how to add icons in the placeholders, if I cant find a way I will trying and wangle them in with positioning.
I will run through the grid module again tomorrow and get cracking.
Watched a fantastic video on youtube of Rachel Andrew, Editor in Chief of Smashing Magazine recreating a BBC News CSS layout live. I used to read Smashing Magazine guides and articles back in the day before I met my now wife and my hobbies were crushed, around the time CSS3 came out fully.

### Day 17: 5-9 May 2020

##### finished second run throught the course! Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hrs) @ FreeCodeCamp using VS Code

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Survey Challenge!!

**Thoughts:**
I wasted a couple of days completing the survey challenge. I starting building both large photo background page and a gradient page I mentioned on day 12 before starting from scratch to practice using css grid.
I have to remember, I dont want to be a designer, I dont want to make trendy looking websites. I want to create functional applications and am just brushing up on html/css before I head into JS, React, etc.
I have learnt so much the last couple of days by just getting stuck in and building the page I had in mind first, then going through the user stories and editing IDs, labels, etc to match the brief.
I have really enjoyed relying less on google searches and just typing out code.
I'm not too happy with the resposiveness of the page so will spend tomorrow tidying that up. I watched a video this morning about using git from the terminal so have been practicing that today committing and pushing from the terminal instead of VS Code. I may have a look at Atom once i'm used to the git syntax which is keeping me tied to vscode. I've also published the site via github pages. I need to update this readme daily as I have forgotten most of my thoughts over the past few days. Font Awesome is quite good for on the fly icons, I used some icons from there (free sub) in the survey page.
