Welcome to my GitHub where I will log my journey through 100 Days Of Coding. I have some experience of HTML, SQL/MYSQL, CSS. I have just started (day 2) Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp and look to continue through to JavaScript and Frontend Libraries. My current goal is to code front ends for SQL databases. In preparation to the 100 days I repurposed a laptop with Linux Debian 10, repurposed an Instagram account, added a GitHub repository, installed VS Code, joined the official 100 day Slack channel and cleaned my home office during the 5th week of Covid-19 lockdown. I will add the code for each of the projects starting with the six at the end of the first course in a week or so. I'll also have a look at GitHub Pages. Stay safe.

### Day 1: 23 April 2020
##### Resposive Web design Certification (300 hrs) @ FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first two modules of Resposive Web design Certification - Basic HTML & HTML5 and Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** Progressed through Basic HTML/HTML5 and CCS as I have previous experience with HTML and CSS2. I particularly enjoyed Classes vs IDs and CSS variables.
